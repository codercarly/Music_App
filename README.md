# Project Overview:
- The project goal was to design the structure of a music app using intents, new activities, array lists, loops and custom classes. 
- The music player app does not actually need to play music.

# Code Incudes:
- Creating new activities
- Using explicit Intents to link between activities in the app
- Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
- A custom class to store information about each song. Each instance must contain at least 2 states (e.g. song name or artist name.) 
- Images are not required but allowed.
- The use of an ArrayList to store information and to efficiently retrieve it.
- Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter.
- 2 – 6 activities that are linked via explicit intents, each labelled, which together make a cohesive app.
- Create and use a custom adapter
- Features are clearly defined either by labelling or images.
- All variables, methods, and resource ID’s are descriptively named.
- Correct naming conventions
- Adheres to best practices
- No unused variables or methods and no commented out code.
- No unnecessary blank lines
